# Features
### New Leaf Litter Types

Fresh, Autumnal and Decayed Birch and Oak Leaf Litter

### Leaf Decay

Similar to copper oxidation, Leaf Litter now "decays" into its different varients over time. Starting green when it spawns with trees, watch it change with your world!

Leaf decay varies with biomes. Wetter biomes can halt leaf decay all together, hot dry biomes will speed it up, and dead biomes will kill your leaves almost instantly.

### Overhauled Leaf Litter Spawning

Leaf Litter now spawns randomly! This includes with trees grown from saplings and even placed leaves!
