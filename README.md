# Major WIP
Expanding on the new "Leaf Litter" blocks added in Minecraft 1.21.5

As of right now a single leaf type has been added. It can spawn naturally and be placed, but has no loot table so it is unobtainable

- [x] Create repository
- [x] Lear to add items and blocks
- [ ] Add more leaf litter types
- [ ] Add leaf decay
- [ ] Add new autumnal trees
